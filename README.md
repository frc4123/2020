FRC team 4123's main repo for the 2020 season.
Currently has auto aim, trajectory following (needs tuning), and smooth driving (voltrage ramp). Things to be done are verify we can read a path
from a json file and add limit switches for fail safes on the robot. PID seems to be minimal and the next major commit will be for distance and shooter
wheel speed integration with a CIMcoder.
